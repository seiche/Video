###Converting Files

**Presets**
```360p```, ```480p``` and ```720p```. Sources videos are converted so that the vertical height matches up with one of these presets. Libx264 is used for the video codec and ogg is used for the audio. Fluent-ffmpeg library has been changed so that the process is not automatically terminated when videos are converting.
